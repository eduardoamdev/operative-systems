## Basic concepts

### What is an operative system

An operative system is an interface between the user and the hardware.

### Hardware components

Hardware components are divided in:

#### Input /output

Hard disk, keyboard, printer, screen...

#### Memory

We can find the following types of memory:

- Primary memory: faster accesss and mostly volatile. Examples: RAM, cache ROM (this last one is also a fast access memory but not volatile).

- Secondary memory: Slower access and non volatile: Examples: Hard disks, pen drives.

When we are talking about memory, we are talking about primary memmory. Secondary memory belongs to the input / output devices.

#### CPU

CPU is divided in:

- Control unit (CU): It is in charge of micro-operations

- Automatic logical unit (ALU): Functional unit (arithmetic and logical operations)
